      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Fundamentals of Computer Engineering is a core subject of the degree that provides an
        introduction to the essential concepts of computer systems. The course covers both
        theoretical and practical foundations, helping students understand how hardware and
        software interact within modern computing systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        This subject is taught by <strong>Professor Moisés Martínez Muñoz</strong>, who guides
        students through the fundamental principles of computer engineering during the first
        year of the degree.
